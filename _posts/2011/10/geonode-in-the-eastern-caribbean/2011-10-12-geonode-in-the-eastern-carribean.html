          <p>Last week, Ariel Núñez, a member of the GeoNode community, participated at a workshop in Grenada entitled "Data Management using Open Source Software in the Caribbean" in which he lead two sessions: one two-hour training for forty participants on using GeoNode and another two-hour training for twenty participants on installing and customizing GeoNode.</p>

          <p>Seven countries and six regional entities participated in the workshop, including <a href="http://www.undp.org">UNDP</a>, <a href="http://www.cdema.org">CDEMA</a> and the <a href="http://www.ccrif.org/">CCRIF</a>.  Many of the participants had already deployed their own GeoNodes with support from The World Bank, bringing the total number of GeoNodes in the region to six: St Lucia, Grenada, St Vincent, UWI Trinidad, Haiti, and the CCRIF. While all the projects are in the very early stages, there's a strong commitment to promoting data sharing between agencies across the Caribbean—not to mention a lot of excitement towards using open standards and better collaborating around disaster risk data more generally.</p>

          <p>Quote of the day: "<em>a wave of excitement has taken over the country,</em>" from Jim Joseph, the St Lucian delegate in reference to their GeoNode project.</p>
