          <p>As we approach the 1.0 release, the GeoNode community has had the opportunity to present the project at a number of conferences, including GSDI, FOSS4G, and LatinoWare.  At each conference we've connected with people who are excited about using GeoNode.</p>

          <p>Check out this presentation if you haven't seen it already: it's an overview of the Vision, Theory, Context, Reality, and Future of GeoNode.  In it, we discuss how GeoNode has been inspired by the best practices of Web 2.0 but has been informed by a deep understanding of the Spatial Data Infrastructure domain.  We also describe what's in version 1.0, what's coming up soon, and how to get involved.</p>
