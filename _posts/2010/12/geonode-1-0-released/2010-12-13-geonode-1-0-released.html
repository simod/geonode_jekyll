          <p>We are happy to announce the release of GeoNode 1.0</p>

          <p>This release is an important milestone for us.  It represents additional commitment by the developers to the stability of the project.  It is also the culmination of over a year and a half of hard work and collaboration on the part of developers, designers, domain experts, and users.</p>

          <p>Thank you to everyone who has been involved in this effort.  Major contributions from OpenGeo, the World Bank, GFDRR, UNISDR, and GEM made this 1.0 release possible.  Volunteer efforts from the community have brought it to the level of quality that we can proudly put forward today.</p>

          <p>We have a lot planned for GeoNode's future.  Soon, we will announce the availability of GeoNode 1.0 installation packages for Ubuntu and CentOS.  We anticipate new partners joining the GeoNode community and investing in all aspects of the software.  Within the coming year we hope to make great strides in enabling GeoNode federation and providing data editing capability, among other improvements.</p>

          <p>For now, spread the word about GeoNode 1.0 and please give us your feedback as you use it.  Your comments will steer the project's future.</p>
