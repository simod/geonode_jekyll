            The GeoNode team is proud to announce the release of GeoNode 2.0. This
            is a huge step forward for the project in usability, stability, and
            flexibility. The team reworked the core to be much easier to customize
            with Django. And then worked out countless bugs so that it is a stable
            server. 2.0 brings a complete redesign of the user experience,
            integrating Bootstrap to enable easier front-end customization.
          </p>

          <p>
            Another huge effort for 2.0 has been
            <a href="http://docs.geonode.org/en/latest/" target="_blank">documentation</a> for users,
            developers and administrators to all get up to speed quickly. The <a href"http://docs.geonode.org/en/latest/tutorials/index.html" target="_blank">tutorials</a> have been used in a number of live workshops, so are battle-tested to work well.
